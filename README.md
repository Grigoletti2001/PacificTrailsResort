# PacificTrailsResort
Website made for CCC CIS 181 Class
Please note that this is my first attempt in uploading to Gitbub. I do not know how to upload an folder directl, however in order for the images to show correctlhy, create a seperate folder and label it "images" and put all of the images in them. By doing that the site should function fine.
